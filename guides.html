        <h2 class="text-center">What is Valorant</h2>
        <p>Valorant is a popular tactical first-person shooter (FPS) video game developed and published by Riot Games. It was officially released on June 2, 2020. Valorant combines elements of traditional FPS gameplay with unique character abilities, similar to hero shooters like Overwatch and hero-based abilities.
    
          <p>1. The game is set in a near-future Earth and features a cast of "Agents," each with their own distinct abilities. Players choose an Agent at the beginning of a match, and these abilities can be used strategically to gain an advantage over the opposing team.
          
          <p>2. Key features of Valorant include:
          
            <p>3. Tactical Gameplay: Valorant emphasizes strategy and teamwork. Teams of attackers and defenders compete in rounds to achieve their objectives, which can include planting or defusing a Spike (similar to a bomb) or eliminating the opposing team.
          
              <p>4. Unique Agents: Each Agent in Valorant has a set of abilities, including a signature ability, two basic abilities, and an ultimate ability. These abilities can range from healing and reconnaissance to deploying barriers and deploying explosive devices.
          
                <p>5. Precise Gunplay: The game places a strong emphasis on precise aiming and gunplay, similar to other popular FPS games like Counter-Strike. Weapons have recoil patterns that players need to learn to control.
          
                  <p>6. Economy System: Valorant uses an economy system where players earn money by completing objectives and eliminating opponents. This money can be used to purchase weapons, shields, and abilities at the start of each round.
          
                    <p>7. Ranked Mode: Valorant has a competitive ranked mode where players can compete against others of similar skill levels and work their way up the ranks.

          <h5>Role: Duelist</h5>
            
        <h5>Description:</h5>
          <p> Jett is a radiant and agile duelist who hails from South Korea. She is known for her lightning-fast reflexes and nimble movements, making her a formidable opponent in combat. Jett's playstyle is characterized by her hit-and-run tactics, allowing her to engage and disengage from fights with ease. She excels at taking down enemies quickly and efficiently, thanks to her versatile abilities.

            <h5> Abilities: </h5>
            
            
                  <h5>Cloudburst (C) :</h5>
                  <p>Jett propels herself upwards by consuming a charge of Updraft. This ability allows her to reach elevated positions quickly or make agile escapes.
            
                      <h5>Updraft (Q):</h5>
                      <p> Jett's ultimate ability equips her with a set of highly accurate throwing knives that deal moderate damage and are lethal on headshots. She can throw these knives one at a time or in a burst of three. Scoring two kills during Blade Storm will refresh the ability for additional throws. Jett's ultimate allows her to be a formidable threat at long range.
            
                            <h5>Blade Storm (X - Ultimate):</h5>
                            <p> Jett's signature ability allows her to dash a short distance in the direction she is moving, enabling her to quickly reposition or engage enemies aggressively.

She is often chosen for her ability to take on opponents in one-on-one duels and create opportunities for her team through her mobility and fragging power. Please keep in mind that the game may have seen updates and changes to Jett's abilities and balance since my last knowledge update, so I recommend checking the latest in-game information or patch notes for any adjustments to her kit.</p>

        <p class="lead">Agent Name: Yoru

          <h5>Role: Duelist</h5>
            
          <h5>Description:</h5>
            <p> Yoru is a master of deception and can manipulate reality to his advantage. He often refers to himself as the "Phantom Thief." Yoru's unique ability to create fake footsteps, teleport, and disorient opponents makes him a disruptive force on the battlefield. He is known for keeping enemies on their toes, never knowing whether he's attacking, retreating, or simply bluffing.
  
              <h5> Abilities: </h5>
              
              
                    <h5>Fakeout (C):</h5>
                    <p>Yoru equips and sends out an echo of footsteps in a straight line. These footsteps mimic the sound of real footsteps, which can confuse and distract enemies. Yoru can trigger the echo to rush forward, creating additional audio deception.
              
                        <h5>Blindside (Q):</h5>
                        <p> Yoru equips and throws an unstable dimensional fragment that bursts into a brief flash of light after hitting a surface. This flash can blind anyone who looks at it, including Yoru himself if he's not careful.
              
                              <h5>Gatecrash (E):</h5>
                              <p> Yoru equips and places a rift tether at a location. He can then reactivate the ability to teleport to the tethered location. This ability allows for quick and unexpected repositioning.
  
            <h5>Dimensional Drift (X - Ultimate):</h5>
                              <p> Yoru's ultimate ability allows him to enter a dimension separate from the map. In this state, he becomes invisible and invulnerable, and he can explore the map freely. He can reactivate the ultimate to return to his original location. Enemies can hear a distorted sound while Yoru is in his Dimensional Drift state.

Skilled Yoru players can use his abilities to gain the upper hand, make unexpected plays, and disrupt the enemy's plans. However, mastering Yoru's unique toolkit can be challenging, as it requires a deep understanding of how to use deception effectively in Valorant's tactical gameplay.</p>

It allows her to change an attack angle quickly or escape danger if need be. Her two Basic Abilities help control areas and set up attacks for Neon and her teammates. 
                                    While she appears to have a strong toolkit at first glance, it is too early to tell where Neon will fall on tier lists. Her unique abilities allow her to pull off maneuvers unavailable to other Agents. However, they don’t offer the best help in team play. Neon could have a tough time fitting into winning Agent compositions at high levels.</p>

                              <p> Phoenix throws a fireball that explodes after a delay or upon impact, damaging and setting on fire anyone caught in the blast. If Phoenix himself is hit by the fireball, he enters a "Heating Up" state, which boosts his fire abilities for a short time.
  
            <h5>Run It Back (X - Ultimate):</h5>
                              <p> Phoenix's ultimate ability marks his current location. If he is eliminated during its duration, or if he manually ends the ability, he is reborn at the marked location. This allows him to take aggressive risks without worrying too much about death during his ultimate.

          <h5>Role: Duelist</h5>
            
          <h5>Description:</h5>
            <p> Reyna is a mysterious and aggressive character with a dark and enigmatic background. She possesses supernatural abilities that allow her to consume the essence of her foes to enhance her own combat prowess. Reyna's playstyle is centered around fragging, as she gains strength and healing capabilities by defeating opponents.
  
              <h5> Abilities: </h5>
              
              
                    <h5>Leer (C):</h5>
                    <p>Reyna equips and sends out an ethereal, destructible eye that, when activated, nearsights any player it looks at. Near-sighted players have reduced vision and can't see enemies or objects clearly.
              
                        <h5>Devour (Q): </h5>
                        <p> When Reyna defeats an enemy, they leave behind a Soul Orb. She can consume these orbs to rapidly heal herself. If her health is already full, she will gain temporary overshields instead.
              
  
                              <h5>Empress (X - Ultimate):</h5>
                              <p>  Reyna's ultimate ability transforms her into her dark, empowered form. While in this state, her fire rate is significantly increased, and she becomes intangible when using Dismiss. Additionally, defeating enemies while in Empress form extends its duration, making her a formidable force to be reckoned with.
  
            <h5>Dismiss (E):</h5>
                              <p>  Reyna can instantly teleport a short distance to a location she selects. This ability enables her to quickly reposition, evade danger, or surprise enemies.

                    <p>Raze equips and deploys a small robot that autonomously navigates the map, bouncing off walls and seeking out enemies. When it detects an enemy in its proximity, it locks on and rushes toward them, causing damage and potentially forcing them out of cover.
  
  
                        <h5>Blast Pack (Q): </h5>
                        <p> Raze throws a satchel charge on the ground, which can be manually detonated to propel her or her teammates into the air. This ability can be used for quick repositioning, reaching elevated positions, or surprising enemies.

Her personality is calm and collected, reflecting her deep understanding of the universe and its mysteries. Astra's abilities allow her to control space, create obstacles, and provide valuable information to her team.

                <p>Nebula / Dissipate (C): Astra equips a star to place a Nebula (smoke wall) at a targeted location. After placement, she can re-equip the ability to turn the Nebula into a star and retrieve it, refunding the cost. This allows her to reposition her smokes during a round.

                  <p>Nova Pulse (Q): Astra equips a star to send out a Nova Pulse, a concussive energy burst that affects all players within its area of effect. This ability is useful for disorienting and slowing down enemies.
                  
                  <p>Gravity Well (E): Astra equips a star to create a Gravity Well, which pulls in and lifts any player caught within its radius. This can disrupt enemy positions and movement, making them vulnerable to attack.
                  
                  <p> Astral Form / Cosmic Divide (X - Ultimate): Astra's ultimate ability allows her to enter Astral Form, where she can place stars anywhere on the map. She can then activate Cosmic Divide, which projects a massive, barrier-like wall across the entire map, segmenting it and reducing visibility for both teams. The Cosmic Divide can be bent and positioned strategically to disrupt enemy sightlines.
            
                                <p>Astra is a strategic Agent who excels in controlling key areas of the map and disrupting enemy movements. Her ability to manipulate smokes and create obstacles makes her a valuable asset for teams looking to control choke points and gain an advantage in Valorant matches.

            <p>Role: Controller
            
                <p>Description:
                  Viper is a mysterious and stoic character who hails from the United States. She has a strong and calculating personality, and her abilities are focused on creating zones of toxic gas to deny areas and disrupt enemy positions. Viper is a master of controlling the battlefield, making her a key asset for teams looking to control map control and choke points.
            
            <p> Abilities:
            
                <p>Poison Cloud (C): Viper equips a gas emitter and places a Poison Cloud at a targeted location. She can reactivate the ability to throw the Poison Cloud, creating a toxic cloud that damages and impairs the vision of any player who enters it. Viper can pick up the emitter and redeploy it in another location.

                  <p>  Snake Bite (Q): Viper equips a cluster grenade that explodes into a series of small, bouncing projectiles that release toxic liquid upon impact. The liquid creates a damaging area on the ground, making it useful for area denial or forcing enemies out of cover.
                  
                    <p>  Toxic Screen (E): Viper equips a deployable screen of gas emitters that she can place in a straight line on the ground. When activated, the screen rises, creating a tall wall of toxic gas that obscures vision. This ability is excellent for cutting off sightlines or creating barriers for her team.
                  
                      <p>  Viper's Pit (X - Ultimate): Viper's ultimate ability creates a massive toxic cloud that covers a large area. Inside the cloud, her vision is improved, and she gains rapid healing. Enemies caught in the cloud take continuous damage and have reduced vision. This ultimate can be a game-changer when used strategically to secure objectives or hold key areas.
                  
                        <p>Viper's playstyle revolves around area denial, disrupting enemy positions, and controlling choke points. Her abilities can limit the options of opponents, forcing them to either push through the toxic clouds or find alternative routes. When played effectively, Viper can be a formidable force on both attack and defense, making her a valuable addition to any team. Please note that the game may have seen updates and changes to Viper's abilities and balance since my last knowledge update, so I recommend checking the latest in-game information or patch notes for any adjustments to her kit.

Omen's abilities are centered around manipulating darkness and teleportation, allowing him to sow confusion among the enemy team and create opportunities for his own.
            
            <p> Abilities:
            
                <p>Shrouded Step (C): Omen equips a shadowy orb and selects a location on the map to teleport to. This ability allows for quick repositioning or sneaky flanking maneuvers.

                  <p>  Paranoia (Q): Omen equips a shadowy projectile that he throws in a straight line. When it impacts a surface, it bursts, creating a blinding effect for any player within its line of sight. This can disorient and blind opponents, making them vulnerable to attacks.
                  
                    <p>  Dark Cover (E): Omen equips a shadowy globe that he can place at a location of his choice. When activated, the globe expands into a vision-blocking sphere of darkness. He can control the distance the globe travels before activation, allowing for precise placement.
                  
                      <p>  From the Shadows (X - Ultimate): Omen's ultimate ability allows him to teleport anywhere on the map. While in this shadow form, he is intangible and immune to damage. He can choose a new location to emerge from, potentially catching opponents off guard.
                  
                        <p>Omen's playstyle revolves around creating chaos and uncertainty for the enemy team. His ability to teleport and obscure vision makes him an excellent pick for players who enjoy surprise attacks and disruptive tactics. Omen can be a master of mind games, using his abilities to keep opponents guessing about his position and intentions. Please note that the game may have seen updates and changes to Omen's abilities and balance since my last knowledge update, so I recommend checking the latest in-game information or patch notes for any adjustments to his kit.

Neon could have a tough time fitting into winning Agent compositions at high levels.</p>
